a random sentence generator (wait, let me explain: a button that randomly shows pre-generated sentences). 
beeing the noob that i am, i used my very limited knowledge w/ html, css & javascript to lay the basics and then teamed up with the mighty chatgpt to create a better layout and understand some deeper java scripting functions. 
the sentences are all original and were created by me feeding chatgpt real-life pieces of literature.
